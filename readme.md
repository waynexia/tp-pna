On the way.

## A PingCAP-specific note

This course, combined with [Deep Dive TiKV], is intended to be enough to enable
programmers to meaningfully contribute to [TiKV]. It is most specifically
designed to teach those in the Chinese Rust community enough Rust to work on
TiKV. The language used is intended to be simple so that those who read only a
little English can follow. If you find any of the language difficult to
understand please [file issues].
